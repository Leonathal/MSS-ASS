## Sports Events Management Platform

# Requirements: 
- 1 (team level) overview diagram, presenting the entire solution
- 2 (individual) diagrams, presenting personal work in the project. Diagrams need to be of two different types and categories (1 structural and 1 behavioral). Note: diagrams need to be created by hand, not generated from code and print screened :) [eg: class diagram from developed code or print screen from DB tools]
- a working application in accordance to presented diagrams: 
  - 2 appropriate design patterns implemented 
  - a working demo 

 # Problem description 
 The platform supports different users/roles (eg. admin, facilitator, player) 
 There are different types of events (eg. indoor/outdoor, 1v1/2v2/11v11, coop or vs, etc). 
 For each event there can be one or more facilitator who will conduct a particular sports activity. 
 Players can make requests to enrol or can be assigned to activities automatically based on their set preferences 
 (confirmation of attendance is explicitly required in this case). 
 Players should have the possibility to view the results of sports events, as well as the leaderboards for the day, week, month, overall. 
 Admins handle any objections or complaints raised by the players, by discussing with the facilitators and awarding points to players, 
 penalties to facilitators or removing access to any of them on the platform.
